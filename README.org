* Description

  Very much a work in progress. At the moment some ROMs will not even
  make it past the title screen (or even get that far). The majority
  that I have tried do work however.

  The current fixed configuration uses these controls:

  | Button | Key         | Description             |
  |--------+-------------+-------------------------|
  | A      | x           |                         |
  | B      | z           |                         |
  | Start  | return      |                         |
  | Select | right shift |                         |
  | D-Pad  | arrow keys  |                         |
  |        | escape      | Quits the emulator      |
  |        | F11         | Toggles fullscreen mode |

  Configurable joystick/gamepad controls are also supported. The
  command:
#+begin_example
  go-gameboy 2>&1 | grep joy
#+end_example
  will display the relevant options.
