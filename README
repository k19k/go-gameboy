go-gameboy: a Game Boy emulator written in Go
=============================================

Very much a work in progress. At the moment some ROMs will not even
make it past the title screen (or even get that far). The majority
that I have tried do work however.

The current fixed configuration uses these controls:

  A Button: x
  B Button: z
  Start: return
  Select: right shift
  D-Pad: arrow keys

Requirements

  Go-SDL (âš›sdl version)
  https://github.com/0xe2-0x9a-0x9b/Go-SDL

Currently supported features:

  - ROMs with MBC chips type 1, 2, or 3 (or none)
  - SDL graphics and input
  - Sound emulation
  - Battery-backed RAM saving

Some missing things:

  - Configurable input
  - MBC RTC support
  - Other MBC types
